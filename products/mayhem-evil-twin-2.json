{"product":{"id":6920423669899,"title":"Mayhem Evil Twin+1 (M)","body_html":"\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e\"The Evil Twin\" is a twin fin + trailer combo developed not just for the \"Evil Twin\" board model, but for any boards that revel on twin fin flare. The template is an exact replica of our twin fins designed for our original RNF close to 25 years ago. A friend in Florida recently dug up an actual mid 90's pair of these hand foiled twins and sent them to me, claiming these large surface area fins relevance today. We immediately prototyped with Futures and loved them. An upright fin, with a swept back tip, and plenty of area. They provide drive and precise pivot. We paired them with a smaller than average trailer, which helps draw out turns and lends some stability and projection, yet retains that free feeling, twin fin feel. I recently used a prototype set on my step-ups, solid backside, overhead Indo surf, where I never thought a twin fin would perform so well, I would actually forget I was using them\" -Mayhem\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e Template Category - Hybrid Keel (drive, pivot, projection)\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e Construction - Honeycomb\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eSize - Medium\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e","vendor":"Futures Fins","product_type":"Fins","created_at":"2022-07-06T14:14:41-07:00","handle":"mayhem-evil-twin-2","updated_at":"2025-08-13T15:13:13-07:00","published_at":"2022-12-01T08:36:11-08:00","template_suffix":"","published_scope":"web","tags":"Fins, Honeycomb, Medium (125-175 lbs) (55-80 kgs), Twin","variants":[{"id":40520789164171,"product_id":6920423669899,"title":"Default Title","price":"130.00","sku":"1059-188-00","position":1,"compare_at_price":"","fulfillment_service":"manual","inventory_management":"shopify","option1":"Default Title","option2":null,"option3":null,"created_at":"2022-07-06T14:14:41-07:00","updated_at":"2025-08-13T15:13:13-07:00","taxable":true,"barcode":"815681025217","grams":408,"image_id":null,"weight":0.9,"weight_unit":"lb","requires_shipping":true,"price_currency":"USD","compare_at_price_currency":""}],"options":[{"id":8907160486027,"product_id":6920423669899,"name":"Title","position":1,"values":["Default Title"]}],"images":[{"id":30199930355851,"product_id":6920423669899,"position":1,"created_at":"2022-07-06T14:15:05-07:00","updated_at":"2023-02-27T15:48:44-08:00","alt":null,"width":1400,"height":1200,"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0332\/4362\/7659\/products\/Futures_product_hero_image_mayhem_evil_twin_M_surfboard_fins.jpg?v=1677541724","variant_ids":[]},{"id":30299501527179,"product_id":6920423669899,"position":2,"created_at":"2022-07-19T16:07:04-07:00","updated_at":"2023-02-27T15:48:44-08:00","alt":null,"width":1400,"height":1200,"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0332\/4362\/7659\/products\/Futures_product_hero_image_mayhem_evil_twin_M_surfboard_fins_single_shot.jpg?v=1677541724","variant_ids":[]},{"id":30923344937099,"product_id":6920423669899,"position":3,"created_at":"2022-10-13T17:07:34-07:00","updated_at":"2022-10-13T17:07:35-07:00","alt":null,"width":1400,"height":1200,"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0332\/4362\/7659\/products\/Futures_product_hero_image_mayhem_evil_twin_M__inboard_surfboard_fins_v2.jpg?v=1665706055","variant_ids":[]}],"image":{"id":30199930355851,"product_id":6920423669899,"position":1,"created_at":"2022-07-06T14:15:05-07:00","updated_at":"2023-02-27T15:48:44-08:00","alt":null,"width":1400,"height":1200,"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0332\/4362\/7659\/products\/Futures_product_hero_image_mayhem_evil_twin_M_surfboard_fins.jpg?v=1677541724","variant_ids":[]}}}
