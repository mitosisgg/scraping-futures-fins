After years of prototyping and fine tuning with his quiver, EE has committed to this thruster set, as his primary fin option. At all Championship Tour stops, in virtually all conditions, this thruster is his go to. The Ethan Ewing signature thruster is built in solid fiberglass construction for a consistent flex pattern, offering stability and control. This signature release is the same DHD template currently available in Honeycomb, but now in Ethan's prefered Fiberglass, with fine-tuned foils, to suit his flawless power surfing on his Darren Handley quiver. Proven to work in all conditions, Ethan has ridden the large size to consecutive Final 5 finishes on the WSL CT, over the last three seasons. Available in medium and large sizes.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eTemplate Category - Rake (drawn out | drive)\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eConstruction - Fiberglass\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eRide Number - Speed Control – 3.3\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e Size - Medium (125-175 lbs) \u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e","vendor":"Futures Fins","product_type":"Fins","created_at":"2025-03-18T11:25:05-07:00","handle":"ethan-ewing-m","updated_at":"2025-08-13T15:13:35-07:00","published_at":"2025-06-24T14:45:23-07:00","template_suffix":"","published_scope":"web","tags":"control series, Fiberglass, Fins, Medium (125-175 lbs) (55-80 kgs), new, Rake, Speed Control (4-1) Solid.
