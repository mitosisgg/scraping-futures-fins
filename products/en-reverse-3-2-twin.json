The “EN” twin template has been a trusted staple in the Futures lineup for many years. The \"Reverse 3\/2\" refers to the twist in the foil, through the top third of the fin, that adds an additional 3 degrees of cant and 2 degrees less toe. The Reverse aspect is that the toe angle straightens only in the tip. This creates two separate foil surfaces, one at the base of the fin and one at the tip, that both feature Future's proprietary Vector foil. This unique foil keeps the fin engaged on rail, creating tons of drive, speed and grip.
