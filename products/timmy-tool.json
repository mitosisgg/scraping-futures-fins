{"product":{"id":4666095108235,"title":"Timmy Tool","body_html":"\u003cp\u003eThe Futures \"Timmy Tool\", named after legendary San Clemente Shaper\/Surfer Timmy Patterson, is used for two purposes. It is used to ensure an even jig plate when routing fin boxes, and also to set the router bit height when not using the one pass cutter. To check that the plate is evenly placed 8mm from the surfboard, place the overhanging piece of the Timmy Tool (above the Futures F) along the machined routing surface of the jig plate. The tools top side should just graze the surface of the foam when level. If necessary use EVA shims until the jig plate is level. The tool is also used to check that the bit height is 33.5mm.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMade In USA\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e","vendor":"Futures Fins","product_type":"Shaper Tools","created_at":"2020-03-18T07:19:43-07:00","handle":"timmy-tool","updated_at":"2025-08-13T15:12:34-07:00","published_at":"2020-03-18T07:19:43-07:00","template_suffix":"","published_scope":"web","tags":"Board Builders, Shaper Tools, Shaper Tools: Tools \u0026 Parts","variants":[{"id":32889654182027,"product_id":4666095108235,"title":"Default Title","price":"4.00","sku":"JIG-TIMMY TOOL","position":1,"compare_at_price":"","fulfillment_service":"manual","inventory_management":"shopify","option1":"Default Title","option2":null,"option3":null,"created_at":"2020-03-18T07:19:43-07:00","updated_at":"2025-08-13T15:12:34-07:00","taxable":true,"barcode":"","grams":113,"image_id":null,"weight":0.25,"weight_unit":"lb","requires_shipping":true,"price_currency":"USD","compare_at_price_currency":""}],"options":[{"id":6061861699723,"product_id":4666095108235,"name":"Title","position":1,"values":["Default Title"]}],"images":[{"id":14774394716299,"product_id":4666095108235,"position":1,"created_at":"2020-03-18T07:20:16-07:00","updated_at":"2020-03-22T18:13:25-07:00","alt":null,"width":1400,"height":1200,"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0332\/4362\/7659\/products\/futures_individual_tools_timmy_tool_surfboard_fins.jpg?v=1584926005","variant_ids":[]}],"image":{"id":14774394716299,"product_id":4666095108235,"position":1,"created_at":"2020-03-18T07:20:16-07:00","updated_at":"2020-03-22T18:13:25-07:00","alt":null,"width":1400,"height":1200,"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0332\/4362\/7659\/products\/futures_individual_tools_timmy_tool_surfboard_fins.jpg?v=1584926005","variant_ids":[]}}}
