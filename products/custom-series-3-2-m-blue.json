The new design works great at freeing up the tail of the board at high speeds, allowing riders to maintain more speed and momentum through every turn. The 3\/2 fins have a very engaged feeling, as though they are glued to the wave. Riders will notice smooth rail to rail transitions, with almost no loss of power. 3\/2’s are available in hand finished Custom Series Fiberglass.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3\/2 refers to the additional surface plane angles at the tip of the fin. Most thruster fins are angled out at 6 degrees and are towed in about 3 degrees, depending on the shaper. The tip has an additional 3 degrees of cant (splay) and an additional 2 degrees of tow angle which gives additional hold throughout turns without sacrificing any speed.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Based off the F6 Template\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e Template Category - Neutral (all-around | versatile)\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e Construction - Fiberglass\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e Ride Number - Speed Control – 3.5\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSize - Medium (125 – 175 lbs)\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003c\/ul\u003e","vendor":"Futures Fins","product_type":"Fins","created_at":"2021-04-13T13:05:12-07:00","handle":"custom-series-3-2-m-blue","updated_at":"2025-08-13T15:12:51-07:00","published_at":"2021-04-22T14:37:24-07:00","template_suffix":"","published_scope":"web","tags":"Fins, Medium (125-175 lbs) (55-80 kgs), Neutral, Thruster","variants":[{"id":39319580639371,"product_id":6557876650123,"title":"Default Title","price":"175.00","sku":"1166-205-00","position":1,"compare_at_price":"","fulfillment_service":"manual","inventory_management":"shopify","option1":"Default Title","option2":null,"option3":null,"created_at":"2021-04-13T13:05:12-07:00","updated_at":"2025-08-13T15:12:51-07:00","taxable":true,"barcode":"","grams":386,"image_id":null,"weight":0.85,"weight_unit":"lb","requires_shipping":true,"price_currency":"USD","compare_at_price_currency":""}],"options":[{"id":8435233390731,"product_id":6557876650123,"name":"Title","position":1,"values":["Default Title"]}],"images":[{"id":28056966430859,"product_id":6557876650123,"position":1,"created_at":"2021-04-13T13:06:15-07:00","updated_at":"2021-04-13T13:06:15-07:00","alt":null,"width":1400,"height":1200,"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0332\/4362\/7659\/products\/cs_3_2_blue_side_fin.jpg?v=1618344375","variant_ids":[]},{"id":28056966693003,"product_id":6557876650123,"position":2,"created_at":"2021-04-13T13:06:20-07:00","updated_at":"2021-04-13T13:06:20-07:00","alt":null,"width":1400,"height":1200,"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0332\/4362\/7659\/products\/cs_3_2_blue_center_fin.jpg?v=1618344380","variant_ids":[]},{"id":28056966758539,"product_id":6557876650123,"position":3,"created_at":"2021-04-13T13:06:25-07:00","updated_at":"2021-04-13T13:06:25-07:00","alt":null,"width":1400,"height":1200,"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0332\/4362\/7659\/products\/Hero_images-Recovered.jpg?v=1618344385","variant_ids":[]}],"image":{"id":28056966430859,"product_id":6557876650123,"position":1,"created_at":"2021-04-13T13:06:15-07:00","updated_at":"2021-04-13T13:06:15-07:00","alt":null,"width":1400,"height":1200,"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0332\/4362\/7659\/products\/cs_3_2_blue_side_fin.jpg?v=1618344375","variant_ids":[]}}}
