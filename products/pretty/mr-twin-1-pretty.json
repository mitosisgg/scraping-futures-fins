    "body_html": "<p>The MR Twin+ 1 set combines the best performance features of a twin fin and a thruster. Pure twin fins are fast, loose, highly maneuverable, and responsive, and the addition of a small stabilizer fin adds an extra degree of drive and control. The large side fins from this set are big enough to be ridden in a pure twin fin configuration and will work in virtually any size or shape board in an optimum surf size range of 1 to 6 feet.</p>\n<p>\"Being pure foiled fiberglass, the construction of my Futures Fin set mirrors the traditional flex characteristics of a hand-foiled fin cut from a multi layered fiberglass fin panel. The 2+ 1 configuration gives the board a twin fin performance feel with additional speed and maneuverability. The small real rear stabilizer fin adds a degree of positive control and predictability. The outline temp for the MR Twin Fin set plus rear stabilizer is over 20 years old. I developed it around 2000 in response to a request from Soeda Surfboards Japan to make some twin fins for the team riders. My pure twin templates have a wide base and are very upright with not a lot of rake. So, I decided to design a new twin fin and small stabilizer template. Feedback from the Soeda team riders was positive, they loved the boards. The moment I got the feedback I got excited and shaped myself a modern twin fin with the 2+ 1 set-up. 24 years later I'm still surfing with these fins and totally frothing on them!!!\"<br>- Mark Richards </p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Construction - Fiberglass</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nGsf8XntAIU?si=lGBPkTwqaicGP6lC\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\"></iframe></span></p>",
