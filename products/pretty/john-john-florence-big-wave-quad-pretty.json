This should hold my tail in, while still providing enough stability with the G-10 construction to hold an edge down the line.\" The speed felt was next level. Full disclosure, this was for </span><span>a specific huge left, with JJF riding on his backhand. In terms of forehand testing, runner-up at the 2023 Eddie can be referenced. Wave of his life, still pending, but it will be a Big Wave. </span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<ul data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Construction - G-10</span></li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Ride Number - Speed Control – 2.2</span></li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Suggested Wave Type - Big Wave</span></li>\n</ul>",
