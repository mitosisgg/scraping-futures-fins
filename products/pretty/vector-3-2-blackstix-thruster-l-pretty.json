    "body_html": "<p><b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Vector 3/2 Blackstix+ is the next evolution in Futures Fins' high-performance fin technology, advancing beyond the previous Vector 3/2 in Alpha construction. Unlike traditional Blackstix, the Blackstix+ features a stiffer layup, ensuring the Vector 3/2 foils stay fully engaged throughout turns. This increased stiffness and resonance enhances drive, hold, and spring back providing more control and power without sacrificing the fluid rail-to-rail transition. The result is a fin that delivers a precise yet responsive, lively feel, making it ideal for surfers looking to elevate their performance in a variety of conditions.</span></b></p>\n<p><b>WHAT IS A VECTOR FOIL<br></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is a proprietary Futures foil with a concave surface on the inside of the front fins, increasing surface area, water attachment, and lift.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>WHAT IS A 3/2</strong><br></span>3/2 complements the Vector with an extra 3 degrees of cant and 2 degrees of toe, introducing a twist to the foil for improved planning angles in sharp turns, creating lift and hold deeper into the maneuver.</p>\n<p><b>PERFORMANCE BENEFITS OF THE VECTOR 3/2<br></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Vector 3/2 is a Speed Generating fin, maximizing water attachment over multiple planing surfaces, resulting in lift and reduced drag. The concave surface and twist in the upper half provide a unique grip and projection sensation, delivering fluid speed generation in smaller waves and powerful connection and increased speed in larger surf, resulting in faster and improved turns.<br></span>Helps connect turns while generating and maintaining speed with a more predictable engaged feel.</p>\n<p><b>BENEFITS OF THE SCIMITAR TIP<br></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Originally developed in 2006, The Scimitar Tip is flattened edge at the fin's trailing end, tightens the turn arc by reducing the template's length. This complements the 3/2 foil's lift and speed design, enhancing the feeling of release from turns while maximizing the foil properties throughout the fin's template.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Construction - </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blackstix </span>\n</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span>Speed Generating</span></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suggested Wave Type - All types | All conditions</span></li>\n<li>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Size - Large (165+ lbs)</span> </li>\n</ul>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Irb_sWBZxjE?si=FrZNOjfNde16R9HY\" title=\"YouTube video player\"></iframe></p>",
